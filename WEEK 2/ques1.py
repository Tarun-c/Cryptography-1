# Question 1
# Consider the following five events:
# Correctly guessing a random 128-bit AES key on the first try.
# Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants (the probability is 1/106 ).
# Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants 5 times in a row (the probability is (1/106)5 ).
# Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants 6 times in a row.
# Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants 7 times in a row.
# What is the order of these events from most likely to least likely?
